# ECS watcher

ECS agent watcher will destroy the instances that are unhealthy. To know if
an instance is unhealthy on the cluster, ECS watcher will check periodically
the status of the instance ECS agent, if this agent is not connected for a given
time, this instance will be marked as unhealthy and the garbage collector will
kill the instance.

## Requirements:

+ Your instances should be in an autoscalation group, ECS watcher only kills instances, it doesn't run again
* Your automated instnaces should connect automatically to the ECS cluster
* YOur serices should be HA, this means that need to have more than one instances per service, remember that
ECS watcher will kill the unhealthy instances without notification

## Minimum usage example:

```bash
ecs-watcher --cluster="slok-ECSCluster1-15OBYPKBNXIO6" --region=us-west-2
```

## Options
```bash
ecs-watcher --help
